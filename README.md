## Description
This repository contains the artifacts related to our paper **Surveillance Disguised as Protection: A Comparative Analysis of Sideloaded and In-Store Parental Control Apps**. The CSV file [apps.csv](apps.csv) contains a list of all 132 tools identified through our manual web search for parental control software. Also included are WHOIS records, Android app availability, Google Play Store links, and Tranco rankings. This dataset encompasses a variety of relevant tools in the parental control software market, from key players to lesser-known solutions. It also provides additional insights into their availability, attributes, and popularity.
The folders [mobsf](mobsf) and [exodus](exodus) contain the output of the static APK analysis of all tested in-store and sideloaded apps, which was conducted using the tools [Mobile Security Framework (MobSF)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) and [Exodus Privacy](https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/).
The [privacy policies](privacy%20policies) folder contains the privacy policies for all analysed apps, where available.

Each file name includes a timestamp in the format "YYYYMMDD", indicating the date when the policy was downloaded.
