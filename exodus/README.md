# Overview

This folder contains output files generated by Exodus Privacy, a tool designed for analysing Android applications. The output was generated using the [standalone version](https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/exodus-standalone). Each file corresponds to one of the 40 apps analysed in the associated research paper, which includes both sideloaded apps and those from the Google Play Store. Additionally, we have included the output file for the installer app of mSpy.

The text files provide insights into the properties, permissions, and trackers of the analysed apps. Rather than decompiling APK files, Exodus Privacy compares Java class names against a [predefined list of known trackers](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/trackers/) and identifies any matches. This method does not guarantee that the identified trackers are actively functioning or that the list is complete.

The output includes general information about each app, such as the app's name, version, and package name. A SHA-256 checksum is also provided, allowing for the verification of the fileâ€™s integrity.

Furthermore, the output lists the permissions requested by the app, identified during static analysis. This information is useful for assessing the potential data access and privacy risks associated with the app. It also includes details about the app's dependencies, such as libraries, certificates, and trackers.
