# Overview

This folder contains output files generated by Exodus Privacy, a tool designed for analyzing Android applications.The output was generated using the standalone version (https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/exodus-standalone). Each file corresponds to one of the 40 apps analyzed in the associated research paper, which includes both sideloaded apps and those from the Google Play Store. Additionally, we have included the output file for the installer apps of mSpy and Spy24.

## Output

The output includes general information about each app, such as the app's name, version, and package name. A SHA-256 checksum is also provided, allowing for the verification of the fileâ€™s integrity.
The text files provide detailed insights into the properties, permissions, and trackers of the analyzed apps. Rather than decompiling APK files, Exodus Privacy compares Java class names against a predefined list of known trackers (https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/trackers/) and identifies any matches. 

Furthermore, the output lists the permissions requested by the app, identified during static analysis. It also includes details about the app's dependencies, such as libraries, certificates, and trackers.

## Notes

Please note that the information provided by Exodus Privacy may contain false positives, such as trackers that are not actively functioning, and that the provided lists are not exhaustive. 

The information provided by Exodus Privacy is useful for assessing the potential data access and privacy risks associated with the apps. Overlapping data from both static analysis tools can be compared and leveraged to complement one another, providing a more comprehensive assessment.
